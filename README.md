# Machine-Learning-Model-Guide
A simple Ground up guide to create a Machine Learning Model, that can be used to find and click images on screen. 

## Introduction
There are several steps to training a machine learning model to find and click images on a computer screen:

1. Collect a dataset of images of the objects you want the model to detect, along with their corresponding coordinates on the screen.

2. Preprocess the dataset by resizing the images and splitting them into training and testing sets.

3. Choose a machine learning model architecture such as YOLO or RetinaNet, and train it on the dataset using a suitable deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

4. Once the model is trained, use it to detect the objects in new images by forwarding the images through the model and interpreting the output.

5. Use the coordinates of the detected objects to simulate clicks on the corresponding positions on the computer screen.

6. If necessary, fine-tune the model with additional data and repeat the above steps until satisfactory performance is achieved.

It's worth noting that this task can be challenging and might require a lot of data to train the model and fine-tuning it. And it might not work as expected in the real-world situation, as the lighting, background, etc can affect the model's ability to detect the objects.
